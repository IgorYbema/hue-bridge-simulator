                    <xsd:element name="jsonPathResponseFilter" type="responseFilter" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1" />
                    <xsd:element name="jqResponseFilter" type="responseFilter" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1" />
                    <xsd:element name="xpathResponseFilter" type="responseFilter" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1" />
